Station BETN070 has one zero value, set to 0.000 and "valid". This causes issues to the MAPE metric (infinity). Was changed to "invalid" (0 status).

The 2x data files for Stations BETR21 and BETR22 were merged into one, for the csv-to-dataframe reading process.

Also, the data officially start from 1995. Removed invalid (statuses: { 0, -1 }) readings of 1994+.
